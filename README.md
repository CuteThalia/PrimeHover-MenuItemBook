This is a modified version of ItemBook.js (original script) for RPG Maker MV.  
In this version, you can also include the Item Book on the player's menu.

### How to Use
* Download the JS file and include it into the ``/plugins`` folder of your project.
* Open the Plugin Manager, select the file **MenuItemBook.js**, and turn it on.
* Don not forget to turn the old version off, if you were using it.

### Parameters

### ChangeLog

* 10/24/2015: Version 1.0
